# Decentralized Identity and Reputation

At the Portugal retreat I presented two talks. One on AI and the other on Reputation and two-sided networks. The AI talk was to provide an overview of different types of AI and provide context relative to the type of AI that is useful for reputation systems as well as decision making in decentralized autonomous organizations.  The Reputation talk provides motivation from a business model perspective on why reputation is essential to platform business models that exploit 2-sided networks. It also motivates why decentralized identity and reputation go hand in glove.
In other words decentralized identity is essential to decentralized reputation which is essential to decentralized 2 sided networks. So one needs to to start with decentralized identity as a foundation. This inverts the architecture of block-chain applications.
